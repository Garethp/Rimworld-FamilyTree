    <description>“Hey Jack!”

“Can it wait? I’m about to make a move on a new recruit I’ve had my eye on, and I don’t need a egghead like you messing things up.”

“Trust me, you’ll be interested. Check out this new iteration of the genealogy readout. Pretty slick, eh?”

“It is, but why are you bothering me about it?”

“I want some feedback about the readability and design of this new model compared to the old one. Here’s a prototype genealogical tree.”

“Ugh, fine... huh, this is much better than that old and clunky list readout. Say... can this display anyone’s family tree?”

“Sure can!”

“Pull up Laura’s tree for me.”

“The lady still mourning the aunt that was vaporized by an antigrain shell? That’s who you’re into?”

“Don’t question my choices! Now let’s see here... what family members can I bribe for a good word...”

“You are one disgusting individual, you know that?”

“Keep your mouth shut, I’m still looking... wait, why am I next to her here?”

“Probably because you are related to her... yep, looks like you’re her first cousin.”

“...”

“Furthermore, it seems she only has one aunt and no uncles. Yes, the aunt we vaporized into a red mist.”

“...”

“Honestly, I can’t blame you for not knowing about this earlier. The old relationship readout must’ve buried your relation with your mother underneath all the ex-lovers you have.”

“...”

“Well, I’ll leave you to it! Have a nice day!”</description>
