This is a form of the fantastic [Fluffy's Relationships Tab](https://github.com/fluffy-mods/RelationsTab/releases) mod, but instead replacing the circle of 
relationships with a Family Tree to keep track of Parents, Children and Lovers over the various generations.


![Notes](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Notes.png)  
 - Being a fork of Fluffy's Relationships tree, I haven't tested to see if they work together. If you want to try using them both at the same time, do so at your own risk.
 - Due to ongoing health issues and an increased amount of work in my day job, this mod is in very low maintenance mode

![Speak up](https://headers.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Speak%20up.png)  

Leaders around the world are deciding on how to respond to Putins' aggression. They are balancing their conscience, and their desire to be re-elected. Many are afraid to impose heavy sanctions because the economic repercussions might loose them votes. The Dutch government, my government, has hinted that they are unwilling to accept Ukranian refugees, and has played a part in allowing Russia to have continued access to international finance. I am ashamed of these actions, taken in my name.

Whereever your live, please let your government know you care more about supporting the people of Ukraine than you do about the price of gas. Join a protest, write letters, call your representatives, and show them that you care about justice!
